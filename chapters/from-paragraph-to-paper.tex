\footnote{\url{https://www.reviveourhearts.com/true-woman/blog/10-reasons-to-reclaim-the-lost-art-of-letter-writi/}}
and \footnote{\url{http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2012/oct/23/lost-art-letter-writing}}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item handwritten letters should be revived for the amount of soul, sentiments and
            long lasting presence they preserve

    \begin{itemize}
        
        \item bring writer's personal style

            \begin{itemize}
                \item see, touch and follow writer's handwriting flow
                \item how the writer accentuate letters and put emphasis on them, showing its 
                        character at the time the letter is written
                \item even before reading words, the writer has sent something nobody else 
                        could have sent
            \end{itemize}

        \item letters takes relationships on

            \begin{itemize}
                \item impress sentiments that the recipient could reread
                \item letters are deliberate acts of exposure, a form of vulnerability
                \item outliving both the writer and the receiver, letter could
                        be opened by loved ones keeping relations in the present
            \end{itemize}

        \item letters keeps time and effort

            \begin{itemize}
                \item requires time slots to prepare, think, write and send: this
                        communicates to the recipient how it is important
                \item allows the writer to speak slowly, letters are forms of "slow communications"
                \item gives to the recipient the gift of time without the pressure to reply
                        as soon as possible, even to not reply at all
            \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

    \item letters can console the grieving, strengthen the weary, and soften hearts
\end{itemize}
