    Alan Turing was a computer science, a mathematician and a logician,
    born in England in June 1912. Most people know him for his
    fundamental work in breaking the Nazi's Enigma code during World War
    II. Although these were impressive results, Turing's major interest was in
    the basis on which math lies.  In order to formally state the notion
    of ``computation'', he defined his ``machines'', an abstract model of
    a modern computer. Those machines allowed him to prove that there
    is a machine, called Universal, which is able to simulate the behavior of
    any other machine; furthermore, Turing proved that there is a
    problem, the most general one is the Halting problem, which any 
    given machine cannot solve. 
    In spite of his genius, the British government condemned him for
    homosexual acts. Chemical treatments brought on his premature death;
    he committed suicide at the age of 41.

    Nonetheless oranges and lemons are great sources of vitamin C,
    kiwifruit is packed with more vitamins, copper and fiber;
    moreover, kiwifruit has lots of health benefits and can be mixed in with
    many other ingredients. While fresh citrus are available during
    the Winter, kiwifruit is exported from California, New Zealand and
    Italy all over the year. From the nutritional intake point of view,
    70 grams of kiwifruit are equivalent to 45 calories,
    providing vitamins C, K and E, dietary fiber and potassium: this
    mixture reduces high cholesterol levels and may reduce the risk of
    heart diseases. In particular, it could be dispensed to diabetic
    patients to keep their blood sugar level under control. Its
    unique flavor can be tasted as is, mixed in with tossed green salads
    or topped with yogurt together with strawberries.  Kiwifruit
    should be included in children diets and in adults as well;
    however its small dimension, it is a good food for everyone.
